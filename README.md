# Traffomatic

Traffomatic aims to provide an easy and efficient solution to the ever-prevalent problem of increasing traffic. Through this application, it is possible to regulate and co-ordinate different traffic signals at crossroads. This automaton provides the best combination of traffic signals at a user-selected location to facilitate least congestion among vehicles. 

# Algorithm

The algorithm used calculates the time for which each signal remains green for each traffic right at the crossroad.

Let the four paths be A, B, C and D.  

To calculate the required time, the algorithm takes as input, the respective time it takes to travel in the current traffic conditions on each path towards the intersection.

1. It calculates the mean of all the four travel times.
2. It finds the deviation of each travel time from the mean i.e (travel_time - mean).
3. It takes a fixed start time (50 sec) and adds the respective deviations to this fixed start time. This gives the green times for the respective signals.

However, some restrictions have been respected by the algorithm.
1. The time for the green signal should be in the range of [20, 70].
2. If we get a green time less than 20, it is uplifted to 20.
3. If we get a green time greater than 70,  it is downgraded to 70.
